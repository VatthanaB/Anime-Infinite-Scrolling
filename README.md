# Infinite Anime Viewer App

This is an anime infinite scrolling app developed for showcasing in my portfolio. The app utilizes Next.js for the front-end framework, Framer Motion for animations, and leverages the power of infinite scrolling to fetch and display anime data from a dedicated API.

## Features

- **Infinite Scrolling:** Enjoy a seamless browsing experience as new anime cards are loaded dynamically as you scroll down the page.

- **Interactive Cards:** Each anime is presented in an interactive card format. Hover animations and framer motion effects enhance the user experience.

- **Next.js Integration:** The app is built using Next.js, a React framework that enables server-side rendering, optimized production builds, and easy deployment.

- **Framer Motion:** Animations are powered by Framer Motion, providing smooth and visually appealing transitions.

- **API Integration:** Anime data is fetched from a dedicated anime API, ensuring that the content is up-to-date and relevant.

- **React Intersection Observer:** The app employs the `react-intersection-observer` library to efficiently handle the infinite scrolling functionality.
